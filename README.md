# The Livepeer Community Node Grants Program

Livepeer has a long term vision to build a fully decentralized video stack, and we cannot achieve this goal without a community of contributors to the project. The Livepeer Grants Program provides funding to projects, ideas and events that benefit the Livepeer ecosystem. The grant program provides contributors with an opportunity to fund their projects and build a position in the Livepeer network. The Livepeer Grants Program will distribute $50,000 in quarterly phases with a semi annual review phase. 

If you're appreciative of this initiative and all that it will do for the ecosystem, stake with our orchestrator node, and contribute a portion of your inflationary reward to go towards these grants! *Node address: 0x4f4758f7167b18e1f5b3c1a7575e3eb584894dbc*

**We are seeking projects and will provide grants for:**
* Pricing Tools: Tools and guides to help enable orchestrators and broadcasters monitor and compare off chain pricing (like an ETHgastation for Livepeer).
* Developer Guides: Tutorials and guides that showcase how to use the Livepeer public network in an application
* Transcoder Pools: The Streamflow proposal introduces the idea of public transcoding pools that operate under the purview of an Orchestrator. Help make this a reality.
* Orchestrator Infrastructure Tools: Tools to help orchestrators better monitor and manage their transcoding infrastructure
* GPU Transcoding & Mining Operation Tools
* Broadcast Tools & Open Source Video Applications
* Community Building & Educational Content
* Protocol Infrastructure 

**Requirements**
* Projects must be open source 
* We are open to funding projects built by teams or individuals, although it helps to have both product/UX + backend for the apps. Find people with complimentary skill sets to join you and collaborate by joining [Discord](https://discord.gg/cmpB7sH) and posting in the #Find-Hackers channel.

**How do I apply?**
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/livepeer/Grant-Program/issues/new/choose). Product-based proposals must include specs in the submission. 
* Include mockups, technical milestones, and time estimates. When in doubt breakdown milestones further. 
* Application will be reviewed by the Livepeer Grant Committee, which meets bi-weekly to discuss all on-going and proposed grants. (If you are interested in joining this committee, ping @nelson, @adam, or @ericxtang in the #community-grants [Discord](https://discord.gg/cmpB7sH) channel.) 
* Feedback will occur throughout the grant process 

**Grants Application Guideline**

* **Measurable result**: There should be success metrics for the grant proposal. The success metrics measure the impact on the community.
* **Achievable**: The proposal should be feasible - and sufficient research should be done ahead of time for its feasibility. If itâ€™s a research grant, a well-formed problem statement should be included.
* **Demonstration of capability**: The grant proposal party should demonstrate sufficient experience to successfully achieve the end goal outlined in the proposal. Prior experience in a similar area is highly preferred.
* **Impact for Livepeer**: The grant proposal should have a direct impact on the success of Livepeer and its community. The grant should be impactful to the success of the proposal.
