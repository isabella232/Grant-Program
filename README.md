# The Livepeer Community Node Grant Program

Livepeer has a long term vision to build a fully decentralized video stack, and we cannot achieve this goal without a community of contributors to the project. The Livepeer Grant Program provides contributors with grants ranging from 300 - 3000 LPT (subject to change). The grant program provides contributors with an opportunity to build a position in the network.

If you're appreciative of this initiative and all that it will do for the ecosystem, stake with our orchestrator node, and contribute a portion of your inflationary reward to go towards these grants! *Node address: 0x4f4758f7167b18e1f5b3c1a7575e3eb584894dbc*

**Grant Amount Range:** 300-3000 LPT

**We are seeking projects and will provide grants for:**
* Pricing Tools: Tools and guides to help enable orchestrators and broadcasters monitor and compare off chain pricing (like an ETHgastation for Livepeer).
* Developer Guides: Tutorials and guides that showcase how to use the Livepeer public network in an application
* Transcoder Pools: The Streamflow proposal introduces the idea of public transcoding pools that operate under the purview of an Orchestrator. Help make this a reality.
* Orchestrator Infrastructure Tools: Tools to help orchestrators better monitor and manage their transcoding infrastructure
* GPU Transcoding & Mining Operation Tools

**Requirements**
* Projects must be open source 
* We are open to funding projects built by teams or individuals, although it helps to have both product/UX + backend for the apps. Find people with complimentary skill sets to join you and collaborate by joining [Discord](https://discord.gg/cmpB7sH) and posting in the #Find-Hackers channel.

**How do I apply?**
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/livepeer/Grant-Program/issues/new/choose). Product-based proposals must include specs in the submission. 
* Include mockups, technical milestones, and time estimates. When in doubt breakdown milestones further. 
* Application will be reviewed by the Livepeer Grant Committee, which meets bi-weekly to discuss all on-going and proposed grants. (If you are interested in joining this committee, ping @nelson, @adam, or @ericxtang in the #community-grants [Discord](https://discord.gg/cmpB7sH) channel.)
* If your application passes screening, we will reach out for a call. 
* Feedback will occur throughout the grant process 
* Process should take 2-4 weeks

**Grants Application Guideline**

* **Measurable result**: There should be success metrics for the grant proposal. The success metrics measure the impact on the community.
* **Achievable**: The proposal should be feasible - and sufficient research should be done ahead of time for its feasibility. If itâ€™s a research grant, a well-formed problem statement should be included.
* **Demonstration of capability**: The grant proposal party should demonstrate sufficient experience to successfully achieve the end goal outlined in the proposal. Prior experience in a similar area is highly preferred.
* **Impact for Livepeer**: The grant proposal should have a direct impact on the success of Livepeer and its community. The grant should be impactful to the success of the proposal.

The following measurements are the success metrics for the grants committee in H1 of 2020.

* Approve / Reject 100% of all applications made for funding
